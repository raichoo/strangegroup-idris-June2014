module Bezier (bezier) where

-- point of arbitrary dimension is just a list of coordinates:
type Point = []

-- parametric line between two points:
line :: Num a => Point a -> Point a -> a -> Point a
line p q t = zipWith interpolate p q
  where interpolate a b = (1 - t) * a + t * b

-- bezier of just one point is fixed at that point,
-- and bezier of a list of points is just linear interpolation
-- between bezier of the initial part of the list
-- and bezier of the tail of the list:

-- raichoo : stuff that can go wrong here
-- 1) call bezier with an empty list
-- 2) mix points of different dimensions
bezier :: Num a => [Point a] -> a -> Point a
